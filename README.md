# My Arch Dotfile

hello everybody, this is my configuration for ArchLinux, just copy and paste it and you will be happy.

I run Arch with **AwesomeWM**.

After you install Arch linux, make sure you install this apps.

```sh
pacman -S sudo grub networkmanager gcc pipewire pipewire-pulse pipewire-audio feh nvim volumeicon gvfs udisks2 xorg xorg-xinit xdg-user-dirs picom kitty firefox awesome thunar network-manager-applet ttc-iosevka rofi polkit-gnome git xclip
```

After that copy my dotfiles to desired directory you wanted, simply to `~/.config/` folder.

Please read every line of my config if you don't want to break your own configuration.

> Note:
> In this configuration I set `arch` as username. So if you find errors message on AwesomeWM, make sure to edit the awesome config file and change it.
