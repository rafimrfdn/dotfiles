# dotfiles

Hello, when I install linux many years ago, I never save my configuration.

It makes me hard to create a new configuration over and over again.

But now I know how to save my system configuration for every distro I've tested by store it on Github.

So here is my dotfiles repo. 

I put every important dotfiles of my `/home/` folder here.

Please select branch based on the distro name.
